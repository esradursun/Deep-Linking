# Deep-Linking
Used the MVVM design pattern and URI Scheme for this application.

The Deep Linking app lists some locations in the tableView and contains a search bar. It calls the Wikipedia app with tapped location or searched location text. 

For being able to do this ability it should have modified the Wikipedia app for directly going to the Places tab and showing the location specified by the calling Deep Linking app.
